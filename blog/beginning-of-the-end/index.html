  <h1>Starting blogging, finally
      </h1>
  <div>
    <p>Hello there.</p>

<p>Initially I set out on writing lengthy blog post about starting blogging but
honestly, who cares?
I will make short status update instead.</p>

<p>Yes, i should have started blogging all those years ago but anyone who knows me
can tell i prefer to keep to myself. There are several reasons why I decided to
start now, but most important comes from my meddling with DDD. Language is a
very important and powerful tool in domain discovery and... I don't know how to use
it!</p>

<p>I have read hundreds of books, countless blog posts, articles and docs but with
no practice it is all in vain. The fact that english is not my native language
does not help either. Great news are there is nothing that can't be improved
with some practice. So this is it: my ranting grounds are officially open.</p>

<p>I did not decide on the design yet. I think I will leave it as is for now. I
can slowly tweak layout and styles over next couple months while I focus on
content first.  Some familiar grounds will be nice to begin with, I suppose.
Simple tutorial maybe?</p>
