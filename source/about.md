#Placeholder

I am an software engineer, specializing on complex custom built PHP-based applications. I design and write [Domain driven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design), [unit tested](https://phpunit.de), [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_%28object-oriented_design%29) object oriented code for a job and learn things for a hobby.

I am a specialist with over a decade of the passionate development experience, [Zend Framework](http://framework.zend.com) expert among other things and [Domain Driven Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design) advocate. A proud user of Fedora linux, git and [neovim](https://neovim.io/). Over the course of my career I totally overlooked only one thing: how to teach others and that is what I am going to master next.

I speak both Russian and English, but English is only third language, right after PHP.
